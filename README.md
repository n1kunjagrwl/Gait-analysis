GAIT ANALYSIS FOR PARKINSON’S SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION

This project is now under consideration for publication, once the paper is accepted I will add the files in this repository.

Abstract:

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressively advancing neurological condition, with its severity often evaluated through clinical assessment utilizing the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging scale.
Such assessments are highly dependent on the clinician’s skill, making the process subjective
and sometimes inconsistent. To address this shortcoming, this article introduces a machine
learning-based gait classification system that can help doctors properly identify the stages of
Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study utilizes an open-access benchmark dataset from PhysioNet
to examine and assess ground reaction force (GRF) data obtained from patients diagnosed with
Parkinson’s Disease (PD). This study presents a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)
classification algorithm that use gradient boosting methods to improve the predictive accuracy of
the target variable. This study employs three more machine learning algorithm namely Decision
Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to predict Parkinson’s
Disease severity. After evaluating on accuracy (98.25%), Precision (98.35%), Recall (98.25%)
and F1 Score (98%), the proposed framework effectively assesses severity based on the
H&Y scale, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Future work can focus on expanding
gait datasets, integrating additional features and wearable sensors, and developing real-time
monitoring systems. Deep learning and explainable AI could enhance accuracy and clinical
adoption.
